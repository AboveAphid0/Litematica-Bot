Alright I can't be bothered writing the instructions right now maybe later but just watch this video which should hopefully allow you to understand:

Oh yea.. I also updated the bot since that video so btw you don't need to convert it to commands as the bot automatically uses the NAME.json file now instead of the NAME-Commands.json file. Because I wanted it to use less space. So yeah.. Bug me on discord to get better info if your confused.
